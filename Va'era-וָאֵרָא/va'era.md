# Va'era

## Summary 
Va'eira, Va'era, or Vaera (וָאֵרָא — Hebrew for "and I appeared," the first word that God speaks in the parashah, in Exodus 6:3) is the fourteenth weekly Torah portion (פָּרָשָׁה, parashah) in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading and the second in the Book of Exodus. It constitutes Exodus 6:2–9:35. The parashah tells of the first seven Plagues of Egypt.

## Notes

### Rod vs. Snake 
>In the fourth reading, God told how Aaron could cast down his rod and it would turn into a snake, and Aaron did so before Pharaoh.[19] Pharaoh caused his magicians to do the same, but Aaron's rod swallowed their rods.[20] 

The point to note here is that the **ROD** swallowed the other rods - it had already turned back to a rod by this point. This was, itself, a second miracle from HaShem.

### Barad

This hebrew word (בָּרָד) is used for both hail and water/italian ice.
