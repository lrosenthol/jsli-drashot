# B'Shelach

## Summary

Soon after allowing the children of Israel to depart from Egypt, Pharaoh chases after them to force their return, and the Israelites find themselves trapped between Pharaoh’s armies and the sea. G‑d tells Moses to raise his staff over the water; the sea splits to allow the Israelites to pass through, and then closes over the pursuing Egyptians. Moses and the children of Israel sing a song of praise and gratitude to G‑d.

In the desert the people suffer thirst and hunger, and repeatedly complain to Moses and Aaron. G‑d miraculously sweetens the bitter waters of Marah, and later has Moses bring forth water from a rock by striking it with his staff. He causes manna to rain down from the heavens before dawn each morning, and quails to appear in the Israelite camp each evening.

The children of Israel are instructed to gather a double portion of manna on Friday, as none will descend on Shabbat, the divinely decreed day of rest. Some disobey and go to gather manna on the seventh day, but find nothing. Aaron preserves a small quantity of manna in a jar, as a testimony for future generations.

In Rephidim, the people are attacked by the Amalekites, who are defeated by Moses’ prayers and an army raised by Joshua.

## Thoughts

- Cloud & Fire leading them (13:21-22)
	וַֽיהֹוָ֡ה הֹלֵךְ֩ לִפְנֵיהֶ֨ם יוֹמָ֜ם בְּעַמּ֤וּד עָנָן֙ לַנְחֹתָ֣ם הַדֶּ֔רֶךְ וְלַ֛יְלָה בְּעַמּ֥וּד אֵ֖שׁ לְהָאִ֣יר לָהֶ֑ם לָלֶ֖כֶת יוֹמָ֥ם וָלָֽיְלָה׃
	The LORD went before them in a pillar of cloud by day, to guide them along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light, that they might travel day and night.

		- representations of HaShem that the people could actually look upon
		- they travelled day and night in order to receive the Torah as quickly as possible.
	
	
	לֹֽא־יָמִ֞ישׁ עַמּ֤וּד הֶֽעָנָן֙ יוֹמָ֔ם וְעַמּ֥וּד הָאֵ֖שׁ לָ֑יְלָה לִפְנֵ֖י הָעָֽם׃ {פ}
	The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.	
		- One was always present, they transitioned one to the other w/o a break.  (just as HaShem is always present)

	- (14:19)			וַיִּסַּ֞ע עַמּ֤וּד הֶֽעָנָן֙ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיַּֽעֲמֹ֖ד מֵאַחֲרֵיהֶֽם׃
	However, when they got to the sea, the fire went away and there was a cloud day and night.  However, at night the cloud traveled from in front to behind them - between them and Egypt - to cast darkness over the Egyptians (Rashi)

	- (14:20) וְלֹא־קָרַ֥ב זֶ֛ה אֶל־זֶ֖ה כׇּל־הַלָּֽיְלָה׃
		so that the one could not come near the other all through the night.


- (14:24-25) We also have the cloud & fire serving to "confound the camp of Egypt".  Rashi says that the cloud make the seabed as mud and the fire would boil it, causing the hooves of the horses to come off.

(16:10)  וְהִנֵּה֙ כְּב֣וֹד יְהֹוָ֔ה נִרְאָ֖ה בֶּעָנָֽן׃ 
and there, in a cloud, appeared the Presence of the LORD.

## Story of the Cloud

During fourty years of wandering, the Israelites were led by a pillar of cloud during the day and a a pillar of fire at night. Moses looked to the pillar of fire to guide them on their journey . When Moses saw eht pillar of cloud rise above the Tabernacle, he stood and cried out to the people, and when they heard this they made ready to journey. They gathered together their vessels and precious things and put them upon their cattle. And anyone who had no beast to carry his burden put all his precious things upon the cloud that went before the camp. And they blew the trumpets, and the tribe of Judah journeyed first. Then the pillar of cloud guided them as they journeyed to the Holy Land. Many centuries later, as Rabbi Moshe Cordovero lay on his deathbed, his disciples begged him to reveal his successor. But the Ramak, as the rabbi was known, refused to do so.  Instead he told them to watch for a sign: whoever saw a pillar of cloud at his funeral would be the one that they should follow.  This greatly confused the disciples and when the Ramak died, all of Tzfat was filled with mourning.
As the funeral procession reached the graveyard, a young disciple named Rabbi Isaac Luria, approached Rabbi Joesph Karo and said: "Ever since we left the synagogue, there has been a pillar of cloud going before us."  He pointed to it but it was invisible to all the others. When we entered into it, he vanished from their sigh.  For a long moment everyone stood in disbelief.  Then Rabbi Isaac stepped out of the cloud which only he could see and his face was glowing like the face of Moshe as he descended Har Sinai.  Indeed it was the same cloud that had enveloped Moshe at Sinai.
Then they all understood that this was the sign the Ramak had given them and that Rabbi Luria was destined to be their teacher.  So it was that after the funeral many of the disciples came to study with him - who was to known as the Ari (Z''L).

This story links Rabbi Moshe Cordovero with Rabbi Isaac Luria the Ari, explaining how the Ari became his successor. Thus, in a single stroke, this links the Ari both to his immediate predecessor, Moshe Cordovero, and to the biblical Moses. The fact that both are named Moses (Moshe in Hebrew) only underscores the link between them. Thus the story suggests that the Ari and his predecessors were at the stature of the biblical patriarchs, and that the miracles of the sort that occurred the time of Moses could still occur in their own time.

## Story of the Fire

At the close of the first Sabbath as the sun set, Adam saw darkness creeping upon him, and he began 'Woe is me· can it be that the serpent is coming to bruise me?"
Then God gave Adam two stones, one of thick darkness and one of death's shadow.
Adam took the stones and struck them together until fire shot forth from them. In amazement,
Adam recited the prayer, "Blessed are You, O God, Who created the light of the
fire." And those words are still repeated in the Havdalah prayer till this day.

Others say that a pillar of fire was sent to Adam to illuminate him and to guard him from all evil. When Adam saw that pillar of fire, he rejoiced, and he put forth his hands to the light of the fire and said, "Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who creates the flames of fire." And when he removed his hands from the light of the fire, he said, "Now I know that the holy day has been separated from the work day here below, for fire may not be kindled on the Sabbath day." And at that hour he said, "Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who divides the holy from the profane, the light from the darkness."
