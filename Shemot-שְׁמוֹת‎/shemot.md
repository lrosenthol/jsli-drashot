# Shemot 

## Summary

Shemot, Shemoth, or Shemos (שְׁמוֹת — Hebrew for "names," the second word, and first distinctive word, of the parashah) is the thirteenth weekly Torah portion (פָּרָשָׁה, parashah) in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading and the first in the Book of Exodus. It constitutes Exodus 1:1–6:1. The parashah tells of the Israelites' affliction in Egypt, the hiding and rescuing of the infant Moses, Moses in Midian, the calling of Moses, circumcision on the way, meeting the elders, and Moses before Pharaoh.

## Notes

### Tevah

The Hebrew word (תבה) that is used for the "basket" that Moshe is placed into only appears once more in the Torah - describing the Ark that Noah built.

NOTE: The Hebrew word for "ark" (tevah) is nearly identical to the Babylonian word for an oblong boat (ṭubbû), especially given that "v" and "b" are the same letter in Hebrew: bet (ב).[21]
